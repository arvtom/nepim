  Examples: nepim -j 239.1.1.1@eth0             ;# by name

+ Cosmetic clean-up.
+ Compilation fix for Solaris.

0.43

+ IPv6 hint for -Fa option added to brief help under -h.
+ Record min/max rates. -mM enables periodic reporting.

0.42
====
+ Keepalive timeout message pointing user to -K option.
+ Included -Fap usage example to README.
+ Failure to receive greeting response points user to -g option.

0.41
====
+ Exclude multicast and zeronet from random IPv4 UDP address (-Fa).

0.40
====
+ -Fa, -Fp for randomizing UDP destination address, port.

====
+ Keepalive options fully moved to client-only control.

0.38

+ Application-layer TCP keepalive timeout can be tuned with -C [interval].

0.37
====
+ Tip for building with 64-bit Solaris.

0.36
